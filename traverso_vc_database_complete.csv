Traverso has solved the fundamental blocker preventing cross-organizational agentic AI: atomic data access without data movement.

The problem: Over 90% of Fortune 2000 depend on value chains, but their AI agents can't collaborate because private data can't be shared or moved. This coordination failure costs billions annually.

Our patented Self-Governing Data Mesh enables:
• Zero-trust atomic data access across organizational boundaries
• Real-time agentic AI execution within each partner's security perimeter
• Full regulatory compliance (GDPR, HIPAA, SOX)
• Sub-second latency vs hours/days for alternatives

We're unlocking a $54-99B market with 2 granted patents, 2 more filed, and design partnerships with F500 manufacturers.

Following up on the cross-org AI infrastructure opportunity.

Quick context on why this matters now: The agentic AI wave is hitting enterprise, but 90%+ of use cases require cross-organizational coordination. Supply chains, healthcare networks, financial ecosystems - all blocked by the same problem.

Existing approaches don't work:
• Federated Learning: Training ≠ operational execution
• Confidential Computing: Data still moves to enclaves
• Clean Rooms: Stale data, coarse permissions, centralized risk
• APIs/EDI: Too slow for real-time agents (1000s of calls/second)

Our stronghold architecture brings computation TO data (not data to computation). Agents execute within each organization's security perimeter with granular, cell-level access control.

One F500 design partner is targeting 30% reduction in supply chain buffer inventory ($2B+ impact) through real-time cross-supplier coordination.

Can I send our technical competitive analysis? It details why alternatives fail for this use case.

Last note - wanted to share why Wing Venture Capital's insights align with what we're building.

Your Snowflake investment shows you understand platform shifts that enable new application categories. We're enabling cross-organizational agentic AI - a category that's theoretically huge but practically blocked today.

Use cases that become possible:
• Supply chains operating as single intelligent systems
• Healthcare networks with real-time care coordination
• Financial ecosystems with instant fraud detection
• Manufacturing networks with predictive maintenance

All require real-time AI coordination across organizational boundaries. All impossible with today's infrastructure.

Market timing is perfect - enterprises are deploying agents internally now and immediately hitting the cross-org wall.

Happy to start with just 15 minutes or send our deck if that's easier.

Last note - wanted to share why Sequoia Capital's insights align with what we're building.

Your Snowflake investment shows you understand platform shifts that enable new application categories. We're enabling cross-organizational agentic AI - a category that's theoretically huge but practically blocked today.

Use cases that become possible:
• Supply chains operating as single intelligent systems
• Healthcare networks with real-time care coordination
• Financial ecosystems with instant fraud detection
• Manufacturing networks with predictive maintenance

All require real-time AI coordination across organizational boundaries. All impossible with today's infrastructure.

Market timing is perfect - enterprises are deploying agents internally now and immediately hitting the cross-org wall.

Happy to start with just 15 minutes or send our deck if that's easier.

Traverso has solved the fundamental blocker preventing cross-organizational agentic AI: atomic data access without data movement.

The problem: Over 90% of Fortune 2000 depend on value chains, but their AI agents can't collaborate because private data can't be shared or moved. This coordination failure costs billions annually.

Our patented Self-Governing Data Mesh enables:
• Zero-trust atomic data access across organizational boundaries
• Real-time agentic AI execution within each partner's security perimeter
• Full regulatory compliance (GDPR, HIPAA, SOX)
• Sub-second latency vs hours/days for alternatives

We're unlocking a $54-99B market with 2 granted patents, 2 more filed, and design partnerships with F500 manufacturers.

Following up on the cross-org AI infrastructure opportunity.

Quick context on why this matters now: The agentic AI wave is hitting enterprise, but 90%+ of use cases require cross-organizational coordination. Supply chains, healthcare networks, financial ecosystems - all blocked by the same problem.

Existing approaches don't work:
• Federated Learning: Training ≠ operational execution
• Confidential Computing: Data still moves to enclaves
• Clean Rooms: Stale data, coarse permissions, centralized risk
• APIs/EDI: Too slow for real-time agents (1000s of calls/second)

Our stronghold architecture brings computation TO data (not data to computation). Agents execute within each organization's security perimeter with granular, cell-level access control.

Last note - wanted to share why OpenView Partners's insights align with what we're building.

Your Calendly investment shows you understand platform shifts that enable new application categories. We're enabling cross-organizational agentic AI - a category that's theoretically huge but practically blocked today.

Use cases that become possible:
• Supply chains operating as single intelligent systems
• Healthcare networks with real-time care coordination
• Financial ecosystems with instant fraud detection
• Manufacturing networks with predictive maintenance

All require real-time AI coordination across organizational boundaries. All impossible with today's infrastructure.

Market timing is perfect - enterprises are deploying agents internally now and immediately hitting the cross-org wall.

Happy to start with just 15 minutes or send our deck if that's easier.

Traverso has solved the fundamental blocker preventing cross-organizational agentic AI: atomic data access without data movement.

The problem: Over 90% of Fortune 2000 depend on value chains, but their AI agents can't collaborate because private data can't be shared or moved. This coordination failure costs billions annually.

Our patented Self-Governing Data Mesh enables:
• Zero-trust atomic data access across organizational boundaries
• Real-time agentic AI execution within each partner's security perimeter
• Full regulatory compliance (GDPR, HIPAA, SOX)
• Sub-second latency vs hours/days for alternatives

We're unlocking a $54-99B market with 2 granted patents, 2 more filed, and design partnerships with F500 manufacturers.

Early stage technology platforms. This aligns perfectly with this infrastructure opportunity. Would love 15 minutes to show you how we're different from federated learning, confidential compute, and clean rooms.

Quick context on why this matters now: The agentic AI wave is hitting enterprise, but 90%+ of use cases require cross-organizational coordination. Supply chains, healthcare networks, financial ecosystems - all blocked by the same problem.

Existing approaches don't work:
• Federated Learning: Training ≠ operational execution
• Confidential Computing: Data still moves to enclaves
• Clean Rooms: Stale data, coarse permissions, centralized risk
• APIs/EDI: Too slow for real-time agents (1000s of calls/second)

Last note - wanted to share why Ridge Ventures's insights align with what we're building.

Your Zapier investment shows you understand platform shifts that enable new application categories. We're enabling cross-organizational agentic AI - a category that's theoretically huge but practically blocked today.

Use cases that become possible:
• Supply chains operating as single intelligent systems
• Healthcare networks with real-time care coordination
• Financial ecosystems with instant fraud detection
• Manufacturing networks with predictive maintenance

All require real-time AI coordination across organizational boundaries. All impossible with today's infrastructure.

Market timing is perfect - enterprises are deploying agents internally now and immediately hitting the cross-org wall.

Happy to start with just 15 minutes or send our deck if that's easier.

Traverso has solved the fundamental blocker preventing cross-organizational agentic AI: atomic data access without data movement.

The problem: Over 90% of Fortune 2000 depend on value chains, but their AI agents can't collaborate because private data can't be shared or moved. This coordination failure costs billions annually.

Our patented Self-Governing Data Mesh enables:
• Zero-trust atomic data access across organizational boundaries
• Real-time agentic AI execution within each partner's security perimeter
• Full regulatory compliance (GDPR, HIPAA, SOX)
• Sub-second latency vs hours/days for alternatives

We're unlocking a $54-99B market with 2 granted patents, 2 more filed, and design partnerships with F500 manufacturers.

Enterprise software growth. This aligns perfectly with this infrastructure opportunity. Would love 15 minutes to show you how we're different from federated learning, confidential compute, and clean rooms.

Quick context on why this matters now: The agentic AI wave is hitting enterprise, but 90%+ of use cases require cross-organizational coordination. Supply chains, healthcare networks, financial ecosystems - all blocked by the same problem.

Existing approaches don't work:
• Federated Learning: Training ≠ operational execution
• Confidential Computing: Data still moves to enclaves
• Clean Rooms: Stale data, coarse permissions, centralized risk
• APIs/EDI: Too slow for real-time agents (1000s of calls/second)

Our stronghold architecture brings computation TO data (not data to computation). Agents execute within each organization's security perimeter with granular, cell-level access control.

One F500 design partner is targeting 30% reduction in supply chain buffer inventory ($2B+ impact) through real-time cross-supplier coordination.

Can I send our technical competitive analysis? It details why alternatives fail for this use case.

Randy","Greg,

Last note - wanted to share why Costanoa Ventures's insights align with what we're building.

Your Qumulo investment shows you understand platform shifts that enable new application categories. We're enabling cross-organizational agentic AI - a category that's theoretically huge but practically blocked today.

Use cases that become possible:
• Supply chains operating as single intelligent systems
• Healthcare networks with real-time care coordination
• Financial ecosystems with instant fraud detection
• Manufacturing networks with predictive maintenance

All require real-time AI coordination across organizational boundaries. All impossible with today's infrastructure.

Market timing is perfect - enterprises are deploying agents internally now and immediately hitting the cross-org wall.

Happy to start with just 15 minutes or send our deck if that's easier.

Traverso has solved the fundamental blocker preventing cross-organizational agentic AI: atomic data access without data movement.

The problem: Over 90% of Fortune 2000 depend on value chains, but their AI agents can't collaborate because private data can't be shared or moved. This coordination failure costs billions annually.

Our patented Self-Governing Data Mesh enables:
• Zero-trust atomic data access across organizational boundaries
• Real-time agentic AI execution within each partner's security perimeter
• Full regulatory compliance (GDPR, HIPAA, SOX)
• Sub-second latency vs hours/days for alternatives

We're unlocking a $54-99B market with 2 granted patents, 2 more filed, and design partnerships with F500 manufacturers.

Leading data infrastructure thinker (MAD landscape). This aligns perfectly with this infrastructure opportunity. Would love 15 minutes to show you how we're different from federated learning, confidential compute, and clean rooms.
